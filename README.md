# Loan-Approval-Prediction
The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real-time) based on customer detail provided while filling out the online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customer segments, that are eligible for loan amounts so that they can specifically target these customers.
CONCLUSION
Random Forest and Logistic Regression are the best model for this prediction since their accuracy_score lies between 0.83 to 0.85. After using all these customer records, we are able to build a machine learning model to accurately predict whether or not the customers in the dataset would get loan approved or not along with that we were able to draw some insights from the data via data analysis and visualization.
